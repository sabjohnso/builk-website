#+TITLE: Wile Website — Implementation Plan
#+STARTUP: showall

* Overview

This plan lays out the phased construction of the wile-scheme website using
Hugo. It is informed by a review of how other programming language communities
present themselves online (Python, Racket, Scala, OCaml, Haskell, Chez Scheme,
GNU Guile, CHICKEN Scheme).

** Design Principles (distilled from the review)

1. *Code first.* The homepage should show wile code immediately. Every feature
   claim should be backed by a runnable example. Racket and Guile do this best;
   Chez Scheme's code-free homepage is the cautionary example.
2. *Clear call to action.* A prominent "Get Started" button in the hero area.
   Every reviewed site that lacked this (Chez) felt like a reference page, not a
   landing page.
3. *Progressive disclosure.* Beginner / intermediate / advanced tiers prevent
   information overload (OCaml, Python, Scala all do this well).
4. *Identity over specification.* Lead with what makes wile distinctive, not
   "R7RS compliant." CHICKEN's "compiles to portable C" and Guile's "extension
   language" are memorable hooks. Wile's hook: a modern, batteries-included
   Scheme with developer tools you'd expect from a mainstream language.
5. *Show vitality.* Recent releases, active development signals. A static page
   with no dates looks abandoned.
6. *Unified documentation.* Keep everything under one roof. CHICKEN's
   fragmentation across subdomains is a usability cost.
7. *Minimal and clean.* Wile is a young project. A small, polished site is
   better than an ambitious one with empty sections.

** Target Audience (in priority order)

1. Experienced programmers curious about Scheme or functional programming.
2. Scheme users evaluating implementations.
3. OCaml developers interested in the implementation.
4. Students and educators.

* Phase 1 — Foundation                                                :infra:

Set up the Hugo project so it builds, has a theme, and can be deployed.

** TODO Choose and install a Hugo theme

Pick a clean, documentation-friendly theme. Strong candidates:

- [[https://github.com/imfing/hextra][Hextra]] — modern docs theme (Next.js-style), built-in search, dark mode
- [[https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book][Hugo Book]] — clean documentation layout
- [[https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod][PaperMod]] — minimal, fast, well-maintained

Criteria: dark mode support, syntax highlighting, responsive, search, minimal
JavaScript, active maintenance, good typography.

Install as a git submodule under =themes/=.

** TODO Create =hugo.toml= with base configuration

- Site title, base URL, language
- Theme selection
- Menu structure
- Syntax highlighting settings (Scheme support via Chroma)
- Taxonomies (tags for docs, if needed)

** TODO Add =.gitignore=

Exclude =public/=, =resources/=, =.hugo_build.lock=.

** TODO Verify the site builds and serves locally

=hugo server -D= should render a placeholder page with the chosen theme.

* Phase 2 — Homepage                                                 :content:

The homepage is the most important page. It must answer three questions in
under 10 seconds: What is wile? Why should I care? How do I start?

** TODO Hero section

- Tagline (something like: "A modern R7RS Scheme — from REPL to standalone
  binary")
- 1–2 sentences of description
- Primary CTA: "Get Started" button
- Secondary CTA: "Try an Example" or link to documentation

** TODO Code showcase section

3–4 tabbed or stacked code examples demonstrating wile's character:

1. *Hello World / basics* — first-class functions, clean syntax
2. *Macros* — hygienic macros with =syntax-rules=
3. *REPL session* — show the interactive experience (paredit, highlighting)
4. *Real program* — something practical (e.g., HTTP, file processing, or a
   small DSL) to show wile is not just a toy

All examples must be valid R7RS that wile can actually run. Verify against
=../wile= before publishing.

** TODO Feature highlights section

A grid of 4–6 cards, each with a short title and one sentence:

- *R7RS Compliant* — all 16 standard libraries
- *Batteries Included* — 31+ bundled SRFIs
- *Developer Tools* — LSP, DAP debugger, profiler
- *Fast Iteration* — FASL bytecode caching, ahead-of-time compilation
- *Embeddable* — OCaml and C APIs
- *Modern REPL* — syntax highlighting, paredit, rainbow parens, completion

** TODO Footer

Organized columns:
- Project (About, License, GitHub)
- Documentation (Get Started, Guide, Reference, SRFIs)
- Community (Discussions, Contributing)

* Phase 3 — Getting Started                                          :content:

A single, self-contained page that takes someone from zero to running wile
code. This is the #1 conversion page.

** TODO Installation instructions

- Prerequisites (OCaml 5.3.0, opam, GMP)
- Step-by-step commands (opam switch, deps, build, install)
- Platform notes (Debian/Ubuntu, macOS)
- Verify installation: =wile --version=

** TODO First program walkthrough

- Start the REPL: =wile repl=
- Evaluate expressions interactively
- Write a =.scm= file and run it: =wile run hello.scm=
- Compile to a standalone binary: =wile compile hello.scm=
- Use a shebang script: =#!/usr/bin/env wile=

** TODO Editor setup

- VS Code + LSP (brief)
- Emacs + LSP (brief)
- Vim/Neovim + LSP (brief)
- Point to the LSP section in the reference for details

* Phase 4 — Documentation Hub                                         :docs:

Progressively disclosed documentation. Start with the most useful pages and
expand over time. Every page should be self-contained and linkable.

** TODO Documentation landing page

A curated index organized by skill level:

- *Getting Started* (link to Phase 3 page)
- *Language Guide* — tutorial-style introduction to wile's Scheme
- *Reference* — comprehensive coverage of built-ins and behavior
- *Tool Guide* — REPL, LSP, DAP, profiler, package manager
- *Embedding Guide* — OCaml and C APIs
- *SRFI Reference* — list of bundled SRFIs with links

** TODO Language guide (tutorial-style)

Progressive chapters:

1. Expressions and values
2. Definitions and functions
3. Data types (pairs, lists, vectors, strings, hash tables)
4. Numeric tower (fixnum → bignum → rational → flonum → complex)
5. Control flow (conditionals, loops, recursion, tail calls)
6. Pattern matching and records (=define-record-type=)
7. Macros (=syntax-rules=, =define-syntax=)
8. Libraries (=define-library=, =import=, =export=)
9. Continuations (=call/cc=, =dynamic-wind=)
10. I/O and ports
11. Error handling (=guard=, exceptions)

Each chapter should have runnable examples verified against =../wile=.

** TODO Tool guide

Separate pages for each developer tool:

- REPL (features, keybindings, paredit mode, customization)
- LSP server (capabilities, configuration)
- DAP debugger (setup, breakpoints, stepping)
- Profiler (usage, flame graph output)
- Package manager (creating packages, dependencies, virtual environments)
- Build system (FASL compilation, ahead-of-time compilation)

** TODO SRFI reference page

A table of all 31+ bundled SRFIs with:

- SRFI number and title
- Link to the official SRFI document
- Import form: =(import (srfi N))=
- Brief one-line description

Generate this from the =../wile/stdlib/srfi/= directory if possible.

* Phase 5 — Supplementary Pages                                     :content:

** TODO About page

- What wile is (elevator pitch)
- Architecture overview (Reader → Expander → Compiler → VM)
- Design philosophy (compilation-only, no interpreter)
- Implementation language (OCaml) and why
- License (MIT)

** TODO Contributing guide

- How to report bugs
- How to contribute code
- Development setup (link to =../wile/CLAUDE.md= conventions)
- Link to GitHub issues

** TODO Releases / Changelog page

- Current version and date
- Changelog entries (can be sourced from git tags or a CHANGELOG file)
- Shows the project is actively maintained

* Phase 6 — Polish and Deploy                                       :infra:

** TODO Syntax highlighting for Scheme

Ensure Hugo's Chroma highlighter renders Scheme correctly. If not, configure
a custom lexer or use a client-side highlighter as a fallback.

** TODO Search

Enable the theme's built-in search (most modern Hugo themes support this) or
add a lightweight client-side search (Pagefind, Fuse.js).

** TODO SEO and metadata

- Open Graph tags for social sharing
- Descriptive =<title>= and =<meta description>= on every page
- Canonical URLs

** TODO Favicon and branding

- Design or commission a simple logo/favicon
- Consistent color palette and typography

** TODO Deployment pipeline

- GitHub Actions: build on push to =main=, deploy to GitHub Pages
- Verify the site builds cleanly in CI before deploying

** TODO Custom domain (if desired)

- Configure DNS and Hugo's =baseURL=
- HTTPS via GitHub Pages or Cloudflare

* Phase 7 — Future Enhancements                                     :future:

These are not part of the initial build but are worth planning for.

** TODO In-browser playground

An interactive Scheme REPL in the browser. This is the single most effective
feature for converting visitors (Python, Racket, Scala, OCaml, and Haskell
all have one). Options:

- Compile wile to WebAssembly (ambitious but ideal)
- Server-side eval with a sandboxed backend (simpler but requires hosting)

** TODO Blog / News section

Hugo has native blog support. Use for release announcements, tutorials, and
design notes. Shows project vitality.

** TODO API reference (generated)

If =odoc= or a similar tool can generate API docs from wile's =.mli= files,
host them as a subsection of the docs.

** TODO Showcase / Examples gallery

A curated collection of interesting wile programs, from one-liners to small
projects. Inspired by Racket's homepage code gallery.
